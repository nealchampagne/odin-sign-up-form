# Odin Sign-up Form

## Description
This is my implementation of the sign-up form project from the Intermediate HTML and CSS course of the Full-Stack JavaScript path from the Odin Project.

This is a non-JavaScript facade of a sign-up form for a non-existent service/product. Mostly the exercise here was to learn how to style form inputs when they are focused, hovered, and/or invalid. The password fields only check whether each field passes the regex pattern, not whether the fields actually match, as this would require JavaScript.
